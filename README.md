# guess-game

    This is a very basic game that I used to learn more about data handling.

    In this game, you will have to enter the length of the word that you want to guess.
    word_fetch.py will fetch a word from the text file and import it into word_guess.py

    In word_guess.py you can enter the the no of incorrect chances you can have.If you 
    are out of chances then the game is over! Otherwise, you WON!
